# loops

DELIVERABLES
Write a loop, that prints all three-digits numbers in decreasing order (999, 998, 997, ..., 101, 100).
using javascript

The three digit numbers in descending order begin from 999 all the way down to 100
In the above case we are using a for loop to print the numbers in descending order.

The for loop is used to iterate over a block of code a number of times.

The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
